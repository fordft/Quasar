//! Fixed, bounded provider requests and one-shot input commitment.

//! Request construction accepts only a token-admitted objective and an

//! optional closed policy-derived navigation checkpoint. The provider body is generated
//! from an immutable instruction and the same closed tool vocabulary decoded
//! locally. It has no arbitrary instructions, provider-native browser tools,
//! selectors, JavaScript, DOM/HTML, prior-response state, or secrets. Normal
//! requests carry no metadata; release-excluded retained public-page probes
//! may carry only fixed non-user metadata labels.

Click uses read for exploring, opening, searching and filtering: a search or filter button may load a results page, which then opens for you. local_write is for reversible local changes. A click that sends, posts, publishes, pays, books, deletes, shares or saves declares its true effect (communication, purchase, destructive or external_write) and must be the batch's only action; the app asks the person when it needs to. Adding to a cart, basket or wishlist is external_write; purchase is only placing the order or paying. Use immediate or mutation_quiet settlement with at least 2000 milliseconds. Verify an effect that lands elsewhere on the page with page_changed. Opening a page dialog requires page_dialog_opened; choosing an item that dismisses it requires page_dialog_closed. Scroll uses read and immediate settlement with scroll_position_changed verification; amount=into_view brings a disclosure listed for scroll into view, never the document; a click, fill or press brings its own control into view, so after a fill act on the next control directly. A native select is chosen with select, never clicked. Press sends one key to a control: Enter in a message box sends what it holds (communication; fill the box first, and never type the key into the text), Enter in a search field searches (read), Escape closes a popup or menu (read), arrow keys move in a list or picker. Rich editors (a message composer, an issue description, a page's blocks) are filled like any text box: fill replaces their text. A form whose several values the goal gives is filled with one fill_form call, never a fill per call. Typed fields take their own format: a number field a plain number such as 12.5, a date field YYYY-MM-DD, a time field HH:MM, an email or web address with no surrounding spaces. A custom dropdown opens with a click; choose its observed option by clicking it, with page_changed verification when the choice closes the list. Follow shown links with the navigate tool.";
